# Call Timer Bot for Discord
A discord bot which can be called a numnber of n minutes.
Will automatically join the VC of the user who called it, and then after n-1 minutes, play a warning notification before kicking everyone from the call at n minutes.

Makes it easier for users in servers to limit the time they spend in a call.

Available commands:
<ul>
<li>Use <code>!help</code> to get the below list of commands.
<li>Use <code>!ping</code> to check the bot is alive.
<li>Use <code>!time</code> <minutes> to start a timer.
<li>Use <code>!time</code> <minutes> while a timer is running to add additional time.
<li>Use <code>!time</code> while a timer is running to check the remaining time.
<li>Use <code>!cancel</code> to stop a timer.
<li>Use <code>!destroy</code> to kill the bot (Warning! This may cause problems with active timers).
</ul>
